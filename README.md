### The State of Fashion
![Mathilda Christensson]("Mathilda Christensson") 

For my first Data Visualization sketch I created a line graph using c3.js exploring the financial profits of fast fashion brands versus luxury brands. I was distinctly interested in developing my coding projects in the realm of the fashion sector. While my other projects thus far have centered around fast fashion versus slow fashion, in this data visualization project I wanted to display the extent of fashion consumption across both fast fashion and luxury fashion brands. What I found from McKinsey's "The State of Fashion Report" from 2019, was that only fast fashion and luxury brands make up the top 20 highest earning profit margins in 2017. Meaning, mid-size companies were not included. Moreover, the top two highest earning were ZARA and Nike. This shows that consumer demand is still most dominant in the fast fashion sector. By displaying the information in the format of a line graph, the viewer of the data visualization is able to see the variance of economic profits across both fast fashion and luxury brands. To see more clearly what economic profit each brand made in 2017, the user can hover over the point on the graph. What's more, labels automatically appear showing what type of brand each name that appears is. This way, the user can easily identify which brand name is a fast fashion brand or a luxury brand. After all the labels have appeared for each brand name, the graph also automatically turns into a bar chart. I added this transformation for the viewer to be presented with a different format for viewing the same information. I was also interested in introducing the subject matter to the reader, to understand the context of the data provided. I thus utilized scroll magic to set up three scenes prior to the data, that explains the substantial economic margins fashion brands proliferate and the stake the fashion sector holds across economic profit globally. Furthermore, I highlighted two questions that I was hoping to probe discussion when viewing the graph. While I am pleased with the resulting data visualization, I would have liked to have explored furthering the data by providing another graph of data showing the profits of just fast fashion brands alone, to provide more information regarding this aspect of the fashion sector. 


For my final project I decided to extend this Data Visualization sketch. Having experimented with html, scroll magic, and c3 in the first data visualization sketch, I realized I wanted to work further with these tools and see how I could extend the narrative of fashion data. Using more information from McKinsey's "The State of Fashion Report" from 2019, I produced 5 graphs displaying different themes of the changing nature of the fashion industry. From the top to the bottom of the scroll, the user encounters different statistics and fashion data, along with breaks in between that explain the information conveyed. I wanted to give the viewer the opportunity to experience viewing the state of the fashion industry (economyically and environmentally) in a digestible and accessible manner. Thus, by including statistics, images, and graphs, the viewer is probed to engage with visual attention in a range of forms, heightening their sense of understanding. The topics covered in this sketch include: the economic profits of fast fashion brands, consumer interest in fashion production transparency, the number of B-Corporation certified brands that are currently in existence, apparel social media engagement across a scope of platforms, and the projected profits of apparel e-commerce in billions of dollars. I found that in creating sketch I was able to include an array of information. I was able to cover the many moving parts of the ways in which that fashion industry is growing, but simultaneoulsy, finding pressure for consumers to slow down their production processes to reduce their environmental impact. I hope with this sketch the user is left further educated about the environmental harms of the fashion industry and understand the major players and ways in which they can make active changes to their shopping habits to reduce environmental harms.
